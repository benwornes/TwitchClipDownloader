# TwitchClipDownloader 

## Features
As of the latest version, this program is a simple command line project
to download clips from twitch given a query.
E.g, "game\_id=510218", The query to search for Among Us clips.

## PlansToImplement

In the future, I plan to implement a feature that will allow someone to search clips
without knowing the specific query.
E.g, including a method that will take in a game name and return game\_id

## If you have any features you want to be added, create an issue and request them!
